# agentic creator Roadmap

generator of agentic solutions


## Development Workflow

1. **Task Planning**

- Study the existing codebase and understand the current state
- Update `ROADMAP.md` to include the new task
- Priority tasks should be inserted after the last completed task

2. **Task Creation**

- Study the existing codebase and understand the current state
- Create a new task file in the `/tasks` directory
- Name format: `XXX-description.md` (e.g., `001-db.md`)
- Include high-level specifications, relevant files, acceptance criteria, and implementation steps
- Refer to last completed task in the `/tasks` directory for examples. For example, if the current task is `012`, refer to `011` and `010` for examples.
- Note that these examples are completed tasks, so the content reflects the final state of completed tasks (checked boxes and summary of changes). For the new task, the document should contain empty boxes and no summary of changes. Refer to `000-sample.md` as the sample for initial state.

3. **Task Implementation**

- Follow the specifications in the task file
- Implement features and functionality
- Update step progress within the task file after each step
- Stop after completing each step and wait for further instructions

4. **Roadmap Updates**

- Mark completed tasks with âœ… in the roadmap
- Add reference to the task file (e.g., `See: /tasks/001-db.md`)

## Enhanced Development Phases

### Phase 0: Workspace Initialization (MANDATORY)
- Clean slate preparation with dependency reset
- Tips consultation for known patterns  
- Environment setup validation

### Phase 0.5: Granular Task Generation (NEW - MANDATORY)
**Purpose**: Replace monolithic task files with detailed, trackable component-level tasks

**Requirements**:
- [ ] **Complete Action Extraction**: Apply 5-layer methodology from docs/planning.md
  - [ ] Entity-driven analysis (CRUD + status actions for all data entities)
  - [ ] UI-specification extraction (all dashboard/page interactions)
  - [ ] Function description mapping (all PRD agent functions)
  - [ ] Workflow-based discovery (all user journey steps)
  - [ ] Cross-reference validation (ensure 100% requirement coverage)

- [ ] **Task File Architecture Setup**: Create `/tasks/` directory structure
  - [ ] `agents/` subdirectory for individual agent action tasks
  - [ ] `frontend/` subdirectory for individual page implementation tasks
  - [ ] `integration/` subdirectory for infrastructure component tasks
  - [ ] Master coordination file for dependency tracking

- [ ] **Agent Task Generation**: Create individual task file per agent action
  - [ ] Use Agent Tool Task Template from CLAUDE.md
  - [ ] Include detailed implementation phases with time estimates
  - [ ] Map dependencies between agent actions clearly
  - [ ] Add comprehensive acceptance criteria per action

- [ ] **Frontend Task Generation**: Create individual task file per UI page
  - [ ] Extract pages from PRD UI specifications section
  - [ ] Use Frontend Page Task Template from CLAUDE.md
  - [ ] Include API integration requirements per page
  - [ ] Plan component reuse from existing frontend

- [ ] **Integration Task Generation**: Create infrastructure component tasks
  - [ ] State schema design and validation
  - [ ] ChromaDB collections setup and configuration  
  - [ ] LangGraph assembly and routing
  - [ ] End-to-end testing and validation

- [ ] **Master Coordination Creation**: Generate dependency tracking file
  - [ ] Map all task dependencies and execution order
  - [ ] Create progress dashboard with completion percentages
  - [ ] Define parallel vs sequential execution opportunities
  - [ ] Establish realistic timeline with milestones

**Quality Gate**: Must validate before Phase 1:
- [ ] All PRD requirements have corresponding task files
- [ ] All discovered agent actions have individual task files
- [ ] All frontend pages have individual task files
- [ ] All infrastructure needs have individual task files
- [ ] Master coordination shows complete system overview
- [ ] Task dependencies are clearly mapped and validated

### Phase 1: Architecture Planning & Specification
- Analyze PRD and reference previous implementations
- Apply comprehensive action extraction methodology  
- Consult `docs/tips.md` for similar business cases
- **Result**: Comprehensive action inventory ready for task generation

### Phase 2: Implementation & Code Generation
- Follow granular task file specifications exactly
- Update individual task progress after each step
- Apply lessons from `docs/tips.md`
- Generate components using detailed task guidance

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation  
- Unit, integration, and scenario testing
- Real LLM conversation validation
- Error resolution with knowledge capture
- Add new learnings to `docs/tips.md`

### Phase 4: Frontend Dashboard Development (NEW)
**Prerequisites**: All backend agents validated, LangGraph server working, chat interface complete

**Purpose**: Extend existing React/Vite frontend with dashboard pages while preserving chat interface

**Requirements**:
- [ ] **Preserve Existing**: Keep current chat interface intact and functional
- [ ] **Add Routing**: Implement React Router for multi-page navigation
- [ ] **Dashboard Pages**: Implement all pages identified in PRD UI specifications
  - [ ] Main Dashboard with project cards and action items
  - [ ] Projects View with filtering and project selection
  - [ ] Checkpoints View with progress tracking (from missing actions)
  - [ ] Suggestions View with priority-based management  
  - [ ] Tasks View with weekly reminders and completion tracking

- [ ] **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket integration for live data updates
- [ ] **Chat Integration**: Ensure all dashboard actions redirect to chat interface
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Maintain consistent UI/UX across all devices

## Current Development Status

- [ ] **Task 001**: Delivery Management Multi-Agent System (DMMAS) Implementation
  - Domain: Project delivery management and coordination
