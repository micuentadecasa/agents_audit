# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Delivery Management Multi-Agent System
## Version 2.1 - Chat-Centric with Simplified Dashboard

## Executive Summary

### Project Name
Delivery Management Multi-Agent System (DMMAS)

### Project Vision
Develop a comprehensive multi-agent system that guides delivery managers through project management via conversational AI. The system provides a simple dashboard for viewing status (lists and cards only) while all actions are performed through chat interactions. A coordinator agent orchestrates access to specialized agents based on project readiness, ensuring users follow best practices while maintaining flexibility.

### Business Context
Delivery managers currently handle multiple projects manually, spending significant time on repetitive tasks like weekly reporting, risk tracking, document creation, and coordinating technical requests. This manual approach leads to inconsistencies, missed deadlines, forgotten tasks, and inefficient resource utilization. The new system will provide a chat-driven experience that ensures project completeness while reducing administrative overhead by 70%.

## 1. User Journey and System Interaction Model

### 1.1 Interaction Philosophy
- **Dashboard**: READ-ONLY viewing of status, lists, and cards
- **Chat**: ALL actions, modifications, and document generation
- **Hybrid**: User views status on dashboard, then goes to chat to take action

### 1.2 Complete User Journey

we need a current project that will be stored in the context of langgraph graph, at the start use one of the current open projects, or if there is no one, ask for details for creating one new. only the projects that have the minimum mandatory fields filled can be used for the agents, so the first thing is to create a project.

#### Stage 1: Project Initiation
1. User ask to create "New Project"
2. System redirects to chat interface
3. Coordinator Agent guides through mandatory data collection
4. Project created and appears as card on dashboard
5. Initial suggestions generated and visible as list on dashboard

#### Stage 2: Daily Operations
1. User views project cards and status on dashboard
2. Sees lists of pending tasks and suggestions
3. Goes to chat to take any action (accept suggestion, complete task, generate document)
4. Dashboard auto-updates to reflect changes

#### Stage 3: Document Generation
1. User requests document generation in chat (PRD, credentials, weekly status text)
2. Agent generates text content based on templates
3. User copies text to update actual documents (PPT, Excel)
4. System tracks document generation history

1. Prepare beta deployment plan for pilot users
2. Execute UAT with pilot group
3. Deploy MVP to pilot users
4. Provide initial support and measure satisfaction
5. Collect key metrics (usage, performance, cost)

#### 4.5.3 Production Project Checkpoints

**Planning Phase:**
1. Define production scope and scalability requirements
2. Complete security and compliance assessments
3. Design high-availability architecture
4. Create detailed project plan with dependencies
5. Establish SLAs and monitoring strategy

**Development Phase:**
1. Implement production-grade code standards
2. Conduct security reviews and penetration testing
3. Performance testing and optimization
4. Documentation and knowledge transfer preparation
5. Disaster recovery planning

**Deployment Phase:**
1. Production environment setup and validation
2. Gradual rollout strategy implementation
3. Monitor production metrics and performance
4. Establish 24/7 support procedures
5. Post-deployment optimization

## 5. User Interface Specifications (Simplified)

the user interface should have pages for showing the info about the projects, showing what is in the database, for example one page for the projects, another for the checkpoints of hte current project, etc, we need a selector to select the current project, and a chat page to work with the agents.
